issues are with this infrastructure:
-SPOF which means that if a critical component or server fails, the entire system could become inaccessible

-Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: with a too much incoming traffic, it will be a lot of pressure on the server, so it can cause the server to be disabled and then the entire site.
