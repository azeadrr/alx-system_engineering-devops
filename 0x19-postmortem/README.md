so before run any update we need two steps: review code and test
first step update and review code

Write clear, concise comments in your code, this will help your developers understand the changes you've made and why it's useful.

second step test your code

Run your tests in a variety of environments and scenarios. This will help ensure that your code works as expected in production, and End-to-end tests test the entire application from start to finish
